# Bomberman
This is a cool retro Bomberman  game.

This game is from the "JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas from scratch" course. Created by Daniel Mizieli≈Ñski. 



Ideas for future development
-Path selection by the enemy
-Drawing a fragment of the canvas where there were changes
-Greater safety zone for hero
-Game sounds
-Fix: Blocked enemy does not start walking after being released
-Points and more lives
-More boards and item types
-More types of enemy
-Different monster reactions: 
	*Running towards the hero, 
	*Throwing at hero
-Bonuses in boxes: 
	*More bombs
	*Bomb detonation
	*Bomb kick
	*Longer bomb range
-Multiplayer ( 4 players)
